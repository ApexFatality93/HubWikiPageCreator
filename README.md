# No Man's Sky - Wiki page creation website!

This is a website intended for making wiki page creation in the [No Man's Sky Wiki](https://nomanssky.fandom.com) easier.

It was originally forked from seamonkey420 who made this in 2017 as a batch script.

To make it more cross platform, with console gamers and other operating systems in mind, it has been ported to the web.

The website was created by [Lenni](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/User:Lenni009) in the name of the [Galactic Hub Eissentam Scribes](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Hub_Eissentam_Scribes), but it's free to use for all players of all Hub branches.

It's also open for other civs/companies/players to make their own version of it. To do so, [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup), [fork the repo](https://github.com/Lenni009/HubWikiPageCreator/fork), edit to fit your needs and create your own GitHub page from it with GitHub pages ([it's super easy to set up](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)).
