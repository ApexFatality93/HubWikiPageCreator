This is not a new insight, others have realised it many years ago, for example seamonkey420, who wrote a wiki page creator as a batch script in 2017 to help with that and make the wiki more accessible.<p>In order to make it cross platform and more accessible, I took the opportunity to learn web development and chose this as my first project.</article><article class=section><h2 class="title is-5">Who made and maintains this?</h2><img src=./assets/bitmap/misc/lenni.png alt="Lenni profile picture"><p>The page creator was made by me, Lenni, from the <a href=Galactic_Hub_Eissentam_Scribes data-wiki>Galactic Hub Eissentam Scribes</a>. I make sure the data is correct after each NMS update, and also fix any bugs that you report.<p>I'm also the director of the <a href=Galactic_Hub_Eissentam data-wiki>Galactic Hub Eissentam</a> and a wiki admin.<p>You can contact me either on Discord or on Reddit:<ul><li>Discord: Lenni#4423<li>Reddit: <a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/Lenni009>u/Lenni009</a></ul></article><article class=section><h2 class="title is-5">How can I contribute?</h2><p>First of all, thanks for wanting to help!<p>There are multiple ways to contribute. Either you directly add to the codebase, or you hunt bugs and report them. But even just using the page creator and creating pages with it gives me feedback about potential pain points when I review the created pages.<p>To contribute, you need to <a href=https://github.com/Lenni009/HubWikiPageCreator/fork>fork the repo</a>. You can then edit the code and open a pull request back to the main repository when you're done.<p>If you come across a bug and want to report it, use either the <a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXFIaHbeCWVsiaeIvcJL0A3aWiB5tQQFf2ofg0dr7lOkDChQ/viewform>feedback form</a>, text me on Reddit or Discord, or submit a <a href=https://github.com/Lenni009/HubWikiPageCreator/issues/new>GitHub issue</a>.</article><article class=section><h2 class="title is-5">Can I make my own version?</h2><p>Yes, absolutely!<p>The app is licensed under the GPLv3 license, meaning you can make your own version, as long as it stays open source and also has the GPLv3 license.</article><article class=section><h2 class="title is-5">Do you collect data?</h2><p>No, the app collects no data. The only data that is saved to your local drive is your currently selected theme. Everything you do here stays on your local computer.</article><article class=section><h2 class="title is-5">What are the plans for the future?</h2><p>Once the Hub specific page creator is done, the project will be expanded to a more general page creator, so that everyone can use it. It will also be localised in some form, meaning other language wikis can be supported, such as German.</article></div><div class=linklist><a href=https://github.com/Lenni009/HubWikiPageCreator class="button is-link">GitHub Repo</a> <a href=https://lenni009.github.io/ class="button is-link">My other web apps</a></div></main></div><footer id=footer class=footer></footer>
